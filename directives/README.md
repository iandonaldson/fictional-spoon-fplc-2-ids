# Directives

This directory contains Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for various workflows.

## Structure

Each directive should follow this template:

```markdown
# [Directive Name]

## Goal
What this directive accomplishes

## Inputs
What information/data is required

## Tools
Which execution scripts to use (from `execution/` directory)

## Process
Step-by-step workflow

## Outputs
What is produced/delivered

## Edge Cases
Known issues, constraints, and solutions
```

## Guidelines

- Directives are living documents that improve through experience
- Update directives when you learn new constraints or better approaches
- DO NOT create or overwrite directives without asking unless explicitly instructed
- Preserve institutional knowledge through directive updates
